# Chest_Xray_Classification_Utilizing_CNN_with_Optimized_Hyperparameters

This study presents a deep learning algorithm developed from the ground up to categorize as well as confirm the existence of COVID in a set of X-ray imaging data. We designed a CNN architecture from the ground up to retrieve elements from provided X-ray data to categorize them and identify the individual contaminated with COVID.

### Dataset Description

Any deep neural architecture work needs a vast amount of data as input. An appropriate cluster of data aids in better analyzing a Deep learning challenge. We gathered data for our issue set mostly from three separate and well-known web sources. The following public datasets were used in this study: 

(1) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

(2) https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9xkhgts2s6

(3) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data

The first Database is used to compile chest X-rays of COVID-19 positive pictures and normal images. Images of bacterial pneumonia are sourced from the second Dataset. Furthermore, photos of pneumothorax are obtained from the third Dataset. The subset of X-ray imagery is built using the datasets to identify and assess the efficiency of the suggested CNN model architecture. 

### Preprocessing & Augmentation

- I resized all pictures to 224 Ã— 224 pixels,

- Used the min-max normalization method to rescale all pixel values [0, 1],

- In addition, I employed photo augmentation for solving the issue of a short dataset and to improve the accuracy rate while limiting model overfitting.
